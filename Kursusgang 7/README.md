# Kursus 7

* Ex1: Create a module lighting up LED 0,1,2,3 when switches 0,1,2,3 (resp.) are closed.

* Ex2: Create a 2-input, 3-output yielding AND, OR and XOR outputs

* Ex3: Create a module where | LD0 = (SW0*SW1) + !(SW2*SW3)

* Ex4: Design a full 1-bit adder

* Ex4: Connect one bit adders from Ex5 to a 4-bit adder using vhdl components. Use switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs.
